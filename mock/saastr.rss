			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bostonvc">David Skok</a> is a serial entrepreneur turned VC at <a href= "http://t.co/8jQCr5dzNi">Matrix Partners</a>. He founded four companies: Skok Systems, Corporate Software Europe, Watermark Software, and SilverStream Software and did one turnaround with Xionics. Three of the companies he founded went public and one was acquired. In 2001 David joined Matrix Partners, who had backed his last two startups, as a General Partner. David’s successful exits as an investor at Matrix include: HubSpot, JBoss, AppIQ, Tabblo, Netezza, Diligent Technologies, CloudSwitch, TribeHR, GrabCAD, OpenSpan and Enservio. David currently serves on the boards of Atomist, CloudBees, Digium, Meteor, Namely HR, Salsify, and Zaius. You can also find <a href="http://t.co/WxKlKF6gyp">David’s amazing blog here!</a> Huge thanks to Hardi Meybaum and Jason Lemkin for the intro to David today.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style= "text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Today’s Episode You Will Learn:</strong></span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the leading indicators that early stage VCs dig deep on to assess the strength of product market fit? What level of traction both in enterprise and SMB would an early stage investor deem exciting enough to pursue? What levels of engagement are sufficient enough to suggest cause for a much larger and increased round?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How should founders assess sales rep productivity? What can they do to actively shorten the ramp time? How will early stage investors analyse the ramp time? What suggests repeatability of process?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does David believe there is no point focusing on CAC/LTV in the early days?

They have raised over $58m in VC funding from some of the best in their space with the likes of Battery Ventures, Spark Capital and Salesforce Ventures, all backing them. As for Bill, prior to Pendo, Bill was the Senior Vice President of Global Sales at Marketo for 8 years. He joined when it was a small venture-backed startup with a mission to reinvent marketing automation. It was his sales leadership and expertise that formed a critical component in building Marketo into one of the fastest-growing enterprise software companies in the world, recognized through his being awarded worldwide VP of sales in 2011.</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style= "text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Today’s Episode You Will Learn:</strong></span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Bill made his way into the world of SaaS and came to be employee #18 at Marketo before making the transition to today, as CRO @ Pendo?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill has said before that career paths are for B players. First, what is wrong with the current thinking around career paths? Why does that inherently mean that A players do not align with them? How can one determine when is the right time to step away from the career paths? What characteristics and attributes do those truly special opportunities have?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill has successfully made the transition from transactional business to enterprise business many times, what have been his core learnings on what it takes to make this transition successfully? What are the biggest challenges in making the transition? How does the internal structure of the team change when making this transition?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does Bill mean when he says you have to “rig the recruiters”? What incentives can be placed in front of them that ensure you will be a priority for them? On the flip side, what incentives do you have to give the recently on boarded employees to encourage grassroots, word of mouth on the company brand?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does the company and sales cycle fundamentally change when moving from $0-1m ARR? What does that mean for the company policy on discounting and pilots? How does the company alter when transitioning from $1-10m in ARR? How can sustainable social validity be built in this stage? How does a company successfully move from $15m-100m in ARR?     </span></li> </ul> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style= "text-decoration: underline;"><strong>60 Second SaaStr?</strong></span></p> <ol> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does Bill know now that he wishes he had known at the beginning?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What keeps Bill up at night?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does Bill mean when he says you have to check your ego?</span></li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to find out more about the show and the guests presented, you can follow us on Twitter here:</span></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlk"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Jason Lemkin</span></a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Harry Stebbings</span></a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/saastr"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">SaaStr</span></a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/billbinch"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Bill Binch</span></a></p> <p>If you’re looking to simplify file version control, ensure data security and save time while increasing accessibility, Egnyte is the right solution for your business.

They have raised over $58m in VC funding from some of the best in their space with the likes of Battery Ventures, Spark Capital and Salesforce Ventures, all backing them. As for Bill, prior to Pendo, Bill was the Senior Vice President of Global Sales at Marketo for 8 years. He joined when it was a small venture-backed startup with a mission to reinvent marketing automation. It was his sales leadership and expertise that formed a critical component in building Marketo into one of the fastest-growing enterprise software companies in the world, recognized through his being awarded worldwide VP of sales in 2011.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">In Today’s Episode You Will Learn:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">How Bill made his way into the world of SaaS and came to be employee #18 at Marketo before making the transition to today, as CRO @ Pendo?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Bill has said before that career paths are for B players. First, what is wrong with the current thinking around career paths? Why does that inherently mean that A players do not align with them?

What are the biggest challenges in making the transition? How does the internal structure of the team change when making this transition?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">What does Bill mean when he says you have to “rig the recruiters”?

On the flip side, what incentives do you have to give the recently on boarded employees to encourage grassroots, word of mouth on the company brand?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">How does the company and sales cycle fundamentally change when moving from $0-1m ARR? What does that mean for the company policy on discounting and pilots? How does the company alter when transitioning from $1-10m in ARR? How can sustainable social validity be built in this stage? How does a company successfully move from $15m-100m in ARR?     </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: center;">60 Second SaaStr?</p> <ol> <li style="font-weight: 400;">What does Bill know now that he wishes he had known at the beginning?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">What keeps Bill up at night?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">What does Bill mean when he says you have to check your ego?</li> </ol> <p>If you would like to find out more about the show and the guests presented, you can follow us on Twitter here:</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlk">Jason Lemkin</a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings">Harry Stebbings</a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/saastr">SaaStr</a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/billbinch">Bill Binch</a></p> <p>If you’re looking to simplify file version control, ensure data security and save time while increasing accessibility, Egnyte is the right solution for your business.

Prior to founding Pipedrive, Timo was a Partner @ Vain & Partners acting in a consultancy role on how to get the best ROI from your sales process and before that was himself a door-to-door salesman with SouthWestern Company selling high ACV products.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">In Today’s Episode You Will Learn:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">How Timo made his way into the world of SMB CRM with the founding of Pipedrive from the days of being a door-to-door salesman of high ACV products?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Why did Timo choose to go global with Pipedrive from day 1? What are the benefits of founders having this global mindset from the start? What are Timo’s biggest learnings in terms of acquiring customers globally early on? What worked? What did not work? How did Timo think about pricing on an individual country perspective? What are the challenges with this?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Having raised from both US and UK VCs, how does fundraising differ when comparing Europe to the US? If Timo had to say the West Coast, East Coast and European VCs each had one area they focus, what would that area be? What are the challenges with these inherent focus points? What advice would Timo have for foreign founders looking to make it big in the US?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">How does Timo look to manage a team so spread across the globe? What are the core challenges of this? What works? What does not work? What functions can be split up by geography? What must remain in one location? Now at 300 people, how does Pipedrive ensure for the same values fit when hiring at scale?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Many VCs say with such low ACV and such high churn, the SMB market is too difficult. How does Timo respond to this? How does Timo think about ensuring the continuous refilling of top of funnel? How does Timo think about acquiring such small customers in a cost efficient manner?    </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: center;">60 Second SaaStr?</p> <ol> <li style="font-weight: 400;">What does Pipedrive look like at $100m ARR?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">What keeps Timo up at night?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Who is Timo’s favourite angel investor?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">What does Timo know now that he wishes he had known at the beginning?</li> </ol> <p>If you would like to find out more about the show and the guests presented, you can follow us on Twitter here:</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlk">Jason Lemkin</a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings">Harry Stebbings</a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/saastr">SaaStr</a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/timorein">Timo Rein</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pieterjan"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Pieterjan (PJ) Bouten</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">is the Founder & CEO @</span> <a href= "https://www.showpad.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Showpad</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">, the world’s leading sales enablement platform that allows for the creation of amazing buyer experiences. To date they have raised over $89m in VC funding from the likes of Insight Venture Partners, Dawn Capital and Hummingbird. As for PJ,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Showpad is the second company he has founded. In 2010 he co-founded the mobile development agency, In The Pocket and still serves on its board. Prior to In The Pocket, Pieterjan held senior roles at Netlog and Accenture.</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style= "text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Today’s Episode You Will Learn:</strong></span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How PJ made his way from the world of Accenture to founding the world’s leading sales enablement platform in Showpad?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was the most challenging element for PJ and Showpad in scaling from $1m-10m in ARR? How does the go-to-market change with this scaling? How does the team structure and composition alter? How does the branding and positioning change?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJ has said before that you must “reiterate value at every touchpoint”, what does he mean by this? How can one look to build a structure and framework to ensure one is effective with this?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/paulalbright">Paul Albright</a> is one of the valley’s most experienced SaaS execs with extensive operational and capital management experience, including 3 IPOs. Most recently Paul was the Founder & CEO @ <a href="https://www.captora.com/">Captora</a>, the marketing acceleration software solution that raised over $25m in VC funding from the likes of NEA and Bain Capital Ventures. Prior to Captora, Paul was Chief Revenue Officer at Marketo where he drove the overall revenue strategy across sales and marketing that delivered global revenue growth over 100% year-over-year, from $14m to $58m. In a similar position at SuccessFactors, he grew revenues to more than $200m and over 80% year-over-year growth. Previously, Paul led worldwide marketing at NetApp and at Informatica, which he joined pre-revenue through their successful IPO. If that was not enough he has also served as an entrepreneur-in-residence at Greylock.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">In Today’s Episode You Will Learn:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">How Paul made his way into the world with the likes of SuccessFactors and Marketo? What were his big lessons from seeing both companies scale into hyper-growth mode?  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Does Paul agree with Dave Kellogg in stating, “CAC/LTV is the single most important metric for SaaS startups? What other metrics must all VPs of Demand Gen and Sales be watching constantly?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">What does an efficient sales and marketing engine look like? What are the core components to build that? What are the requirements to both run this engine and scale it quickly? How does the growth of this engine affect hiring in other parts of the business?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Why does Paul believe that it is much harder to go SMB up than enterprise down?
